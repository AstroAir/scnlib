Introduction

``scnlib`` is a modern C++ library for scanning values.
Think of it as more C++-y ``scanf``, or the inverse of
`fmtlib`_.

The repository lives on the `scnlib GitHub`_.

This documentation is for the version 2.0 of the library.
This version is currently experimental, and under development, with no stability guarantees.
For a stable release, see version 1.x.
